## API

### tory.describeFolder(folderPath, [options])

Obtains a thorough JSON representation of the given folder (except for the actual contents of the files - only their sizes are reported).

#### folderPath

Type: `string`

The path to be inspected.

#### options

Type: `object`

##### maxDepth

Type: `number`\
Default: `Infinity`

The maximum depth to be recursed into.

* No recursion: `0`
* Look into the subfolders, but no further: `1`

##### skipFolder
